# smoker-nonsmoker-face-wrinkle-cnn
This project aims to classify facial images as "Smoker" or "Non-Smoker" by analyzing wrinkle patterns using computer vision and deep learning. The workflow includes face detection, alignment, wrinkle map extraction using a Hybrid Hessian Filter, and classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
